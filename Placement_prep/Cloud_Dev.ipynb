    "# Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### A cloud is a combination of services, networks, hardware, storage, and interfaces that helps in delivering computing as a service.\n",
    "### Cloud can be referred as Internet. It is any service that is delivered over the internet like storage, computing, and networking.\n",
    "### Cloud involves 3 parties: end-user, business management user, and cloud service, provider\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. On-demand service (provides Agility, flexibility, and scalability)\n",
    "### 2. Broad network access (anytime, anywhere without location constraints)\n",
    "### 3. Resource pooling (shared resources)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud Delivery Models/ Cloud service layers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service)\n",
    "#### CSP does provisioning of  storage, networking, virtualization and various utility software elements , User is responsible for the management of the operating system, middleware, and applications. E.g. Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paas (Platform as a Service)\n",
    "#### Infrastructure as a Service with an abstracted set of middleware services, so􀈅ware development, and deployment tools. allows users to focus on the application development. E.g. Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saas (Software as a Service)\n",
    "#### business application created and hosted by a provider in a multi-tenant model. E.g. Google Docs, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Cloud : \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A public cloud is a platform that uses the standard cloud computing model to make resources \n",
    "#### such as virtual machines, applications or storage \n",
    "#### available to users remotely. Public cloud services may be free or offered through a variety of subscription or on-demand pricing schemes, including a pay-per-usage model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unlike private clouds, public clouds can save companies from the expensive costs of having to purchase, manage and maintain on-premises hardware and application infrastructure - the cloud service provider is held responsible for all management and maintenance of the system. Public clouds can also be deployed faster than on-premises infrastructures and with an almost infinitely scalable platform. Every employee of a company can use the same application from any office or branch using their device of choice as long as they can access the Internet. While security concerns have been raised over public cloud environments, when implemented correctly, the public cloud can be as secure as the most effectively managed private cloud implementation if the provider uses proper security methods, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advatages : Scalability , Lower capital \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best For : startups , indivisuals \n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Cloud(On - premises) :\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A private cloud is a cloud computing model where the cloud service provider is responsible for the hardware and software infrastructure. The cloud service provider is also responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure. Private clouds are typically more expensive than public clouds, but they can be more flexible and can be deployed faster than public clouds. Private clouds can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. e.g. Rackspace Openstack \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Advatages : Security , flexibility , Greater control and customization\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Best For : Large companies , banks , Government \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybrid Cloud :\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A hybrid cloud is one in which applications are running in a combination of different environments. Hybrid cloud computing approaches are widespread because almost no one today relies entirely on the public cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid cloud refers to a mixed computing, storage, and services environment made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud—such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure—with orchestration among the various platforms. Using a combination of public clouds, on-premises computing, and private clouds in your data center means that you have a hybrid cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best For :   insurance companies  , hospitals , banks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-Cloud :\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Serverless \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Serverless means building of applications to take place without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. One can write code without having provision to a server. Serverless machines take care of virtual machines and container management, Multithreading, hardware allocating are also taken care of by the serverless components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud Native\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‘Cloud native’ is a so􀈅ware framework designed with containers, microservices, dynamic orchestration, and also continuous delivery of so􀈅ware. In simple words, building software that is designed to run in the cloud enviroment irrespective of the cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vertical scaling\n",
    "#### Vertical scaling (or scaling up/down) is upgrading or downgrading the hardware, for example, upgrading the size of an instance from t2.micro to t2.medium. Vertical scaling is commonly used for databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontal scaling \n",
    "#### Horizontal scaling (or scaling in/out) is increasing or decreasing the number of instances used by your application or system. For example, increasing the number of EC2 instances from 2 to 4.Horizontal scaling is commonly used for web applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elasticity \n",
    "#### The ability to horizontally scale, meaning the ability to add or remove servers of the same size.\n",

    "# DevOps\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Devops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.It is a so􀈅ware engineering practice that focuses on bringing together the development team and the operations team for the purpose of automating the project at every stage. This approach helps in easily automating the project service management in order to aid the objectives at the operational level and improve the understanding of the technological stack used in the production environment.\n",
    "### Automation at each stage of the project life cycle is the key to DevOps. \n",
    "\n",
    "### KPIs of DevOps (Key Performance Indicators)\n",
    "#### 1. Reduce the average time taken to recover from a failure.\n",
    "#### 2.  Cost/Quality of service\n",
    "#### 3. Increase Deployment frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "## DevOps Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan -> Code and Build -> Integrate -> Test -> Release(Deploy) -> Operate -> Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A container is a packaged so􀈅ware code along with all of its dependencies so that it can run consistently across clouds and on-premises. This packaging up of code is o􀈅en called encapsulation. Encapsulating code is important for developers as they don’t have to develop code based on each individual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Microservices are a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and change. It also allows you to scale, or add computing resources, to individual services as needed. Microservices can be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.\n"

    "#### Programming languages are computer languages that are used to instruct the computer to perform some functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow of execution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### source code -> compiler -> object code -> linker -> executable code (machine code)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tpes of programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Low level language ->  requires assembler for translation , machine dependent , e.g. assembly language like NASM\n",
    "#### 2. High level language -> requires compiler/interpreter for translation , machine independent , e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### also we have 2 types of programming languages based on the way they are executed\n",
    "#### 1.Imperative programming language ->  e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, etc. (procedural, object oriented)\n",
    "#### 2. Declarative programming language -> e.g. SQL, Prolog, etc.   (logic, functional ,Database)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High level language is further divided into\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural Vs Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Procedural programming ->  a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedure call. It uses procedures to structure a computer program into a number of subroutines, which contain a sequence of computational steps to be carried out. The main aim of procedural programming is to break down a complex problem into smaller and simpler problems. It is also known as structured programming. it has controlled flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "### E.g. Python , Java , JS , PHP , C++ , C# , Ruby , Swift , Scala , R , Scala , Dart , Groovy , Kotlin , etc.\n",
    "## Advantages of OOPs\n",
    "#### Procedural language is based on functions but object oriented language is based on real world objects.\n",
    "#### Procedural language gives importance on the sequence of function execution but object oriented language gives importance on states and behaviors of the objects.\n",
    "#### Procedural language exposes the data to the entire program but object oriented language encapsulates the data.\n",
    "#### Procedural language follows top down programming paradigm but object oriented language follows bottom up programming paradigm.\n",
    "#### Procedural language is complex in nature so it is difficult to modify, extend and maintain but object oriented language is less complex in nature so it is easier to modify, extend and maintain.\n",
    "#### Procedural language provides less scope of code reuse but object oriented language provides more scope of code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting due to better code maintenance\n",
    "### 2. Code Reusability.\n",
    "### 3. Faster development and increased Productivity\n",
    "### 4. allows to break a large program into small chunks\n",
    "### 5. Security due to encapsulation and abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of OOPs\n",
    "### 1. larger size than procedural programming\n",
    "### 2. Can not applicable to every problem\n",
    "### 3. requires more timea and skills to develop"

    "### Constructor Overloading\n",
    "#### Constructor overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one constructor with different parameters. It is a way to provide more flexibility to the programmer to create an object of a class.

It can be defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator ::. It can be declared using the keyword friend.\n",

    "## Binding\n",

The implementation in the derived class overrides (replaces) the implementation in the base class. It is only possible in C++ and Java. if in python multiple constructor are defined in same class , then constructor mentioned at last will be used\n",

An abstract class may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. Methods declared without an implementation are abstract methods. A class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract. The abstract keyword appears before the class keyword.\n",

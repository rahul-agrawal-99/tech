A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems. There are many different proxy server configurations, such as an open proxy, which is accessible by any Internet user, or a reverse proxy, which is an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A proxy server may reside on the user's local computer, or at various points between the user's computer and destination servers on the Internet.

Wireshark is cross-platform, with native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also available for some Unix variants, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.

    "## VPN\n",
    "#### A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic encryption. Virtual tunneling protocols, such as Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), or Layer 3 Tunneling Protocol (L3TP), do not actually tunnel the data, but only the header. They are therefore sometimes referred to as tunneling protocols. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TOR\n",
    "#### Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name \"The Onion Router\". Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms\". Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities from being monitored. Tor also provides a way to access sites on the Deep Web. The software was originally developed for the U.S. Navy's research laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, for use by U.S. intelligence agencies. The Tor project was officially released in 2006 as free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License version 3. The Tor Browser is a web browser based on Firefox ESR, configured to connect to the Tor network. The Tor Browser is free and open-source software for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

    "#### A torrent is a file containing metadata that describes the files and folders to be downloaded. The metadata typically describes the name and size of the files, and a link to the tracker, which is a server that helps participants find each other. The tracker is a computer that keeps a list of which pieces each peer has. The tracker also helps peers find each other by providing a list of IP addresses of other peers.

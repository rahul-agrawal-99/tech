Every Deadlock is always a starvation but not every starvation is a deadlock.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. Circular Wait\n",
    "####  To violate circular wait, we can assign a priority number to each of the resource. A process can't request for a lesser priority resource. This ensures that not a single process can request a resource which is being utilized by some other process and no cycle will be formed.\n",

    "## Resource Allocation Graph (Deadlock Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### it is a directed graph where each vertex represents a process and each edge represents a resource.

    "\n",
    "### 1. Kill 1 process or more processes  -> process which has done least amount of work until now.\n",

Preempt the resource ->  snatch one of the resources from the owner of the resource (process) and give it to the other process with the expectation that it will complete the execution and will release this resource sooner.

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data is nothing but facts and statistics stored or free flowing over a network\n",
    "\n",
    "# DataBase\n",
    "### The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently . Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information\n",
    "\n",
    "# DBMS\n",
    "### Database management system (DBMS) is a software that manage or organize the data in a database. We can arrange the data in a tabular form (i.e. in row or column). It helps the user to retrieve the data from the database. \n",
    "#### E.g. MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of DBMS\n",
    "#### 1. Controls database redundancy\n",
    "#### 2. Data sharing\n",
    "#### 3. Data security\n",
    "#### 4. Easily Maintenance\n",
    "#### 5. Backup\n",
    "#### 6. Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of DBMS\n",
    "#### 1. Cost of Hardware and Software\n",
    "#### 2. Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.\n",
    "#### 3. Higher impact of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of DBMS Over File Processing System (Traditional System):\n",
    "#### The absence of indexing in a traditional file-based system leaves us with the only option of scanning the full page and hence making the access of content tedious and super slow\n",
    "#### The other issue is redundancy and inconsistency as files have many duplicate and redundant data and changing one of them makes all of them inconsistent in traditional file-based system\n",
    "#### Another issue is the lack of concurrency control, which leads to one operation locking the entire page, as compared to DBMS where multiple operations can work on a single file simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Abstraction\n",
    "### For ease the user interaction with database, the developers hide internal irrelevant details from users. This process of hiding irrelevant details from user is called data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We have three levels of abstraction:\n",
    "### Physical level: \n",
    "#### This is the lowest level of data abstraction. It describes how data is actually stored in database. You can get the complex data structure details at this level.\n",
    "### Logical level: \n",
    "#### This is the middle level of 3-level data abstraction architecture. It describes what data is stored in database.\n",
    "### View level: \n",
    "#### Highest level of data abstraction. This level describes the user interaction with database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID Properties are used for maintaining the integrity of database during transaction processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Atomicity: \n",
    "### A transaction is a single unit of operation. You either execute it entirely or do not execute it at all. There cannot be partial execution.\n",
    "## • Consistency: \n",
    "### Once the transaction is executed, it should move from one consistent state to another.\n",
    "## • Isolation: \n",
    "### Transaction should be executed in isolation from other transactions (no Locks). During concurrent transaction execution, intermediate transaction results from simultaneously executed transactions should not be made available to each other. (Level 0,1,2,3)\n",
    "## • Durability: \n",
    "### After successful completion of a transaction, the changes in the database should persist. Even in the case of system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# TYPES OF DBMS ARCHITECTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Single Server Architecture \n",
    "### database is in application server , mainly used in development phase\n",
    "# 2. Two Tiew Architecture \n",
    "### database and application is in two separate servers , application connection interface such as JDBC, ODBC are used application is responsible for data access and data manipulation\n",
    "# 3. Three Tier Architecture \n",
    "### client application doesn’t communicate directly with the database systems present at the server machine, rather the client application communicates with server application and the server application internally communicates with the database system present at the server\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL\n",
    "### SQL stands for Structured Query Language · SQL lets you access and manipulate databases · SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987\n",
    "\n",
    "# DBMS Languages\n",
    "## Database languages are used to read, update and store data in a database. \n",
    "### There are several such languages that can be used for this purpose; one of them is SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL/DBMS Languages Types :\n",
    "\n",
    "## • DDL - Data Definition Language:       \n",
    "###  CREATE , DROP , ALTER , TRUNCATE , COMMENT , RENAME\n",
    "## • DML - Data Manipulation Language:         \n",
    "### INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n",
    "## • DCL - Data Control Language:            \n",
    "### (GRANT,REVOKE)  GRANT-gives user’s access privileges to database. REVOKE-withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command\n",
    "## • TCL - Transaction Control Language:            \n",
    "### COMMIT , ROLLBACK , SAVEPOINT->sets a savepoint within a transaction\n",

    "# DataBase Relations\n",
    "## • One to One\n",
    "## • One to Many\n",
    "## • Many to Many\n",
    "\n",
    "# Drop Vs Truncate Vs Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "## DROP \n",
    "### DROP is used to delete a whole database or just a table.The DROP statement destroys the objects like an existing database, table, index, or view.Table or Database deletion using DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so it must be used wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "## TRUNCATE \n",
    "### It is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces but it does not alter table structure . The TRUNCATE TABLE mytable statement is logically (though not physically) equivalent to the DELETE FROM mytable statement (without a WHERE clause).\n",
    "\n",
    "## DELETE\n",
    "### DELETE is used to delete records from a table. It is comparatively slower than the TRUNCATE command. we can also use delete instead of Truncate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "### +, -, *, /, %, ^\n",
    "## • Comparison Operators\n",

    "\n",
    "# Keys (7 types) [ PAC-SAC-F ]     \n",
    "\n",
    "### Keys help you to identify any row of data in a table. Keys ensure that you can uniquely identify a table record despite any challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "####  7 different types of Keys in DBMS and each key has its different functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Super Key \n",
    "###  Super key is an attribute set that can uniquely identify a tuple. A super key is a superset of a candidate key. Every set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row is a super key.\n",
    "#### E.g. {Rollno, Name, Address} is a super key for the table Student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Candidate Key \n",
    "###  Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes.\n",
    "#### E.g. {Rollno, Name} is a candidate key for the table Student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Primary Key \n",
    "###  it is single or multiple columns which uniquely identifies a row in a table. It is also candidate key.\n",
    "#### E.g. {Rollno} is a primary key for the table Student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Alternate Key \n",
    "###  it is candidate keys other than primary key. if only one candidate key is present then it is primary key then alternate key does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Foreign Key \n",
    "### it is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity.\n",
    "#### E.g. {Rollno} is a foreign key for the table Student and Toppers\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Composite key\n",
    "### Whenever a primary key consists of more than one attribute, it is known as a composite key. This key is also known as Concatenated Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## • Artificial Key / Surrogate Key\n",
    "###  The key created using arbitrarily assigned data are known as artificial keys. These keys are created when a primary key is large and complex and has no relationship with many other relations. These kind of key are unique because they are created when you don't have any natural primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ER model  (Entity-Relationship)\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is a high-level data model. This model is used to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system.  \n",
    "### It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy to design view of data.\n",
    "### Here Entity is a real-world object and relationship is a connection between two or more entities.\n",
    "### Entity type is a set of entities that share the same properties. Relationship type is a set of relationships that share the same properties.\n",
    "### Entity set is a collection of entities of the same type. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts of Database\n",
    "### 1. Row -> record , tuple , entity , object\n",
    "### 2. Column -> attribute , field , property , entity type\n",
    "### 3. Table -> relation , entity set , table type\n",
    "### 4. Schema -> database schema , database structure , database design , Intension\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normalization\n",
    "###  process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table helps to organize the data in the database. \n",
    "### It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.\n",
    "### main reason for normalizing the relations is removing Insertion Anomaly ,Deletion Anomaly and Updatation Anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Decomposition \n",
    "#### the process of breaking up or dividing a single relation into two or more sub relations is called as decomposition of a relation.\n",
    "### Dependency\n",
    "#### A dependency is a relationship between two attributes of a relation. A dependency is said to exist between two attributes if the value of one attribute determines the value of another attribute.\n",
    "### Transitive Dependency\n",
    "#### A transitive dependency is a dependency that exists between two attributes of a relation through a third attribute. A transitive dependency is said to exist between two attributes if the value of one attribute determines the value of another attribute through a third attribute.\n",
    "#### E.g. If A is dependent on B and B is dependent on C, then A is transitively dependent on C.\n",
    "### non-prime attributes   \n",
    "#### attributes that can not be combined with other attributes to form a composite key.in short , non-prime attributes are the attributes that can not be  part of the primary key.\n",
    "### Data Redundancy\n",
    "#### Data redundancy is the duplication of data in a database. It is a situation where the same data is stored in more than one place in a database. It is a common problem in relational databases. It is a problem because it increases the storage space and increases the risk of data inconsistency.\n",
    "### Functional Dependency\n",
    "#### Functional Dependency is the starting point of normalization. It exists when a relation between two attributes allow you to determine the corresponding attribute's value uniquely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Normal Form \n",
    "### A table is in first normal form if \n",
    "###  1. it has no duplicate rows i.e. atomic values\n",
    "###  2. an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only single-valued attribute. for this separate the records having duplicate values and store such that no duplicate records are present in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second Normal Form \n",
    "###  A table is in second normal form if\n",
    "###  1. Obeys All rules of first normal form\n",
    "###  2. all non-prime attributes are fully functional dependent on prime attributes \n",
    "#### i.e. non-prime attribute is dependent on prime attribute, which is a proper subset of the candidate key. then table is not in 2NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Third Normal Form \n",
    "###    A table is in third normal form if\n",
    " ###       1. Obeys All rules of second normal form\n",
    " ###       2.  no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes,\n",
    " ###       3. it does  not contain any transitive partial dependency.\n",
    "#### e.g. if A is dependent on B and B is dependent on C, but C is prime attribute, then it is not in 3NF\n",
    "#### in this case , separate A , B  and  B , C\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF) \n",
    "###  A table is in BCNF if\n",
    "###  1. Obeys All rules of third normal form\n",
    "###  2.  no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of candidate key.\n",
    "#### e.g. if A is dependent on B and B is dependent on C, but C is prime attribute, then it is not in BCNF\n",
    "\n",
    "# Denormalization\n",
    "###  Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve performance. It is the opposite of normalization. Denormalization is used to improve the performance of the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Cursors\n",
    "### Cursor is a temporary work area that stores the data, as well as the result set, occurred after manipulation of data retrieved. A cursor can hold only one row at a time.\n",
    "## 2 types of cursors\n",
    "### 1. Implicit Cursor -> declared automatically when DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE is executed.\n",
    "### 2. Explicit Cursor -> have to be declared when SELECT statements that are returning more than one row are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Warehousing\n",
    "### The storage as well as access to data, that is being derived from the transactions and other sources, from a central location in order to perform the analysis is called Data Warehousing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Mining\n",
    "### Data mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns from large volumes of data. It is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Lake\n",
    "### A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Big Data\n",
    "### big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can't manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checkpoint / Savepoint\n",
    "### Checkpoint declares a point before which all the logs are stored permanently in the storage disk and is the inconsistent state. In the case of crashes, the amount of work and time is saved as the system can restart from the checkpoint. implementation of checkpoint is done by the database system using ROLLBACK\n",
    "\n",
    "# B-Tree\n",
    "### B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database Locking\n",
    "### A database lock is a mechanism to protect a shared piece of data from getting updated by two or more database users at the same time. When a single database user or session has acquired a lock then no other database user or session can modify that data until the lock is released.\n",
    "## 2 types of locking\n",
    "### 1. Shared Lock (S Lock) -> allows multiple users to read the data at the same time.\n",
    "### 2. Exclusive Lock (X Lock) -> allows only one user to read or write the data at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",

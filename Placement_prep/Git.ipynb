    "### \t *repository consists of a list named .git, where git holds all of its metadata for the catalog\n",
    "### \t *A bare repository is the same as default, but no commits can be made in a bare repository. The changes made in projects cannot be tracked by a bare repository as it doesn’t have a \t\tworking tree. \n",
    "### \t *Git config used to configure your choice for the Git installation. Using this we can describe the repository behavior, preferences, and user information.\n",
    "### \t * Staging Area/Index : When you are making the commits, you can make innovation to it, format it and review it in the common area\n",
    "### \t * commit : \"records changes to the storehouse\" \n",
    "### \t * Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository\n",

    "#### \t/* HEAD is pointer pointing to current commit id. HEAD~N  can be used to point previous commits according to order\n",
    "#### \t/* Detached HEAD :state Where Head doesn't point to most recent commit. If you checkout with an older commit, it will stand the detached head condition\n",
    "#### \t/* dont use --force , use --force-with-lease   it will push only thode having no conflicts and prevents overwriting over conflicts\n",
    "#### \t/* Tags are Branch specific\n",
    "#### \t/* use git rm to track deleted files in staging area\n",

    "#### Linux treats all hardware devices (such as hard drives, printers, monitors, terminal emulators, and CD/DVD drives) as special files. This means that an application program can access and use files and devices in the same way. This feature makes developing programs in Linux easier and flexible.Linux places all special files or device files under the /dev directory.\n",

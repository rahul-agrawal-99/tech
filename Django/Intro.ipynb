    "#### Django includes an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows developers to interact with databases in a Pythonic way, without having to write SQL queries directly.\n",
    "#### It has built-in support for various security features, including cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, and password hashing.\n",

The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response.\n",

    "#### Class-based views (CBV): These views are implemented as Python classes, where different HTTP methods are mapped to different class methods. They provide a lot of built-in functionality, such as form handling, pagination, and authentication. CBVs are more powerful and flexible than FBVs, but can be more complex to write and understand.\n",
    "#### Generic views: These are pre-built class-based views that provide common functionality, such as displaying a list of objects or a detail view of a single object. They are designed to be used as building blocks for more complex views.\n",
    "#### Viewsets: These are classes in DRF that define the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a resource, such as a list of blog posts or a list of users. They provide a consistent API for these operations and can be used to generate URLs and views automatically.\n",
    "#### API views: These are specialized views in DRF that handle API requests and responses. They provide features such as content negotiation, authentication, and serialization, and are optimized for building RESTful APIs.\n",

For example, a view decorator can be used to check if a user is authenticated before calling a view function. If the user is not authenticated, the view decorator can redirect the user to the login page. View decorators are defined as Python functions that take a view function as an argument and return a modified view function. They are applied to a view function by adding the @decorator_name decorator above the view function definition. For example, the following view decorator checks if a user is authenticated before calling a view function.
